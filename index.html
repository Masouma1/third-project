					What is javascript?
				</header>
				<p>
					JavaScript is a programming language for the web.
                     Its syntax is based on Java and C languages.
                      Used in both the front-end and back-end of 
                      many platforms, JavaScript has become a
                       standard. For every animated or interactive
                        object you see online, chances are
                         JavaScript is involved.

                    JavaScript’s language is widely used to 
                   create a more interactive front-end.
                    Still, it is used in competition with
                    other languages to create web scrapers,
                     servers, and many other tools. This is 
                     because of the language and design decisions
                     made when creating the language.

				<p> JavaScript is the most popular coding language.
					<br> Features of the JavaScript language:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) support</li>
					<li>Language Interpretation</li>
					<li>Prototype-based Language</li>
					<li>Client-side validations</li>
					<li> Async processing</li>
                    <li>More controls in Browser</li>

					Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) support
				</header>
				<p>
					OOP principles have been more refined in the “ES6”
                    JavaScript version. Principles such as 
                    “Encapsulation” and “Inheritance” are considered
                    the key aspects of OOP in JavaScript. These features
                    are available for everyone to explore.

					The JavaScript interpreter is a core 
                    browser component that runs the script
                    line by line. Therefore, JavaScript
                    is also known as an “Interpreted
                    Language”. However, most modern
                    engines of JavScript utilize
                   “Just-In-Time” compilation to
                    execute code.

                    <header>Prototype-based Language :</header>
				<p>
				

					JavaScript is a scripting language 
                    that is based on prototypes. Instead 
                    of classes or Inheritance, prototypes
                    are also used for creating objects for 
                    a specific class and multiple objects 
                    can be declared with the specified prototype.
                    However, in Java, firstly, a class is created,
                    and then you are allowed to declare an object
                     according to the class type.

					Client-side validations
				</header>
				<p>
					Every website includes a form where
                    it is required to enter data. To ensure
                    that the user submitted the correct value, 
                    it is needed to implement the proper validations
                    on both the server and client-side. In such a
                    scenario, the client-side validations are 
                    implemented with the help of JavaScript.

            <section  class="main-section" id="Async">
                <header>Async processing</header>
                <p>
                    When an asynchronous request is made
                     via <b>“Promises”</b>, JavaScript does not wait 
                     for its response, which sometimes becomes a
                      reason for blocking the request.<b>“ES6”</b>  also
                       embeds <b>“Async functions”</b> that execute in parallel,
                        which affects the processing time in a good way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript supports several tools which 
                    help the developers in distributing the 
                    workload between browser and server through
                     different activities such as basic validations
                      and temporary data storage in cookies. In 
                      addition to it, the following useful features
                       are also introduced in the JavaScript latest version:
                </p>
                <ul>
					<li>JavaScript has an extensive collection of built-in libraries with many advanced functions for data type conversion, validation, and string operations.</li>
					<li>It can detect browser name, type, operating system version, and other related client information for analysis.</li>
					<li>It also supports complex data types such as maps, arrays, lists, collections, and built-in methods for their manipulation.</li>
